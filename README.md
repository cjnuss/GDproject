## Program Controls - Press N to start.
### HUD
We are currently in progress of completing the HUD and dungeon layout for our game, this is a top priority and is currently being addressed.

### General Game Commands
If at any time you wish to exit the game, it can be simply done with the press of the Q key on your keyboard. We currently have a feature which allows you to reset the room to its original state by pressing the reset key, R.

### Link Movement
Link can be moved around the screen by pressing the W,A,S,D or arrow keys. This will cause Link to be move up, left, right, or down with respect to the keys.

### Link Attacking
Link has several different options to attack with. Currently, Link is starting with an infinite number of green arrows, fire, bombs, and blue arrows. These items can be used by pressing the 1, 2, 3, and 4 number keys on the top of your keyboard respectively. Link also has the ability to perform a sword attack. This can be accessed by pressing either the Z or N key. Link also has the ability to do a magic sword beam attack. This can be done by pressing the X key.

### Dungeon Room Transition
Currently, Mouse input is required to transition between different rooms in the dungeons. A left-click will transition to the next room, and a right-click will transition to the previous room. Currently, we have three rooms, and the fourth room is used for debugging purposes with all items present.

## Known Bugs
### Collision
We are aware of multiple issues with collision in our code which either produce unusual or unexpected behavior. These issues are also in the process of debugging and are currently being addressed.
